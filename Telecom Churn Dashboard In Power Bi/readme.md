**By Demography:**
* Here we can see the total customers, total male, total female in the dateset and total churned customers in which how many are male customers and how many are female customers.
* We have got the insight that senior citizens are the one who have churned the most so we deep dive into senior citizen data. 
* I have tried to find out how many of the churned senior citizens are having partners.
* Found the distribution of male and female in the data of churned senior citizen and total senior citizens.
